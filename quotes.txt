"It's a great program. No magic formula. A lot of learning by doing. Coaches are all non-profit and teaching because they want to give back. Incredible sense of community and team spirit. And the whold process is a 12 week journey at the end of which I actually learned what I was set out to learn, and even more. Keep it up" - Bulgar the Dimovian

"In a world where most "pick up" products and people are marketing artists of bullshit, MMG is like winning the lottery. A ton of guys with amazing skills, uplifting attitudes, and powerful dedication to sharing them. Tiny teaher-to-student rations for maximum guidance. Getting in on this is getting in to a club, buildign killer friendships on a journey to a sexually-fulfilling lifestryle. Hands down the most excellent way to gain these skills I've ever found. THIS. IS. IT."  -Seth
